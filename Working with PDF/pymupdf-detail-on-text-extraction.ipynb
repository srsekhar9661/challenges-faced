    "# General structure of a TextPage\n",
    "    TextPage is one of (Py-) MuPDF’s classes. It is normally created (and destroyed again) behind the curtain, when Page text extraction methods are used, but it is also available directly and can be used as a persistent object. Other than its name suggests, images may optionally also be part of a text page:\n",

    "        <image block>\n",
    "            <img>\n",
    "    A text page consists of blocks (= roughly paragraphs).\n",
    "\n",
    "    A block consists of either lines and their characters, or an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A line consists of spans.\n",

    "    A span consists of adjacent characters with identical font properties: name, size, flags and color."
