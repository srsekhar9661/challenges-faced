    "Extracting Text from within a Rectangle\n",
    "Extracting text from within specific rectangular areas of a document page is frequently required.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyMuPDF, you can select from several options to achieve this. All methods are applicable to all document types support by MuPDF - not only PDF. Choose the right method from the following list:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Page.get_text(\"words\")\n",
    "This is an old, standard extraction method. The method delivers a list of tuples, which each represent one string without spaces (called a \"word\") - together with its position. Each tuple looks like this: (x0, y0, x1, y1, \"string\", blocknumber, linenumber, wordnumber). The first 4 items are the coordinates of the bbox that surround \"string\". The last 3 items are block number on the page, line number in a block, word number in a line.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to write a script which selects the words contained in (or intersecting) the given rectangle by using the bbox coordinates, then sort the result, and then glue words together again that belong to the same line.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach can cope with documents where text is not stored in desired reading sequence: you will probably sort the word list by vertical and then by horizontal coordinates. You may also find a way to put words in the same line even if their vertical coordinates differ by some small threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script textbox-extract-1.py is an example for such a script. It also implements two word selection alternatives: one with only accepting fully contained words, and a second one including intersecting words.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Page.get_textbox(rect)\n",
    "Returns text contained in the rectangle 'rect'. Text appears in the sequence as coded in the document. So it may not be in a desirable reading sequence. Inclusion of text is decided by character and words may hence appear mutilated. Line breaks may be present, but one final line break will be omitted. See the example script textbox-extract-2.py in this folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Page.get_text(\"text\", clip=rect)\n",
    "This is one of the old, standard extraction methods. The clip parameter is new and was introduced in version 1.17.7. If clip is not None, the result looks like the previous method's output, except that there always is a final line break.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes\n",

    "\n",
    "Output of textbox-extract-1.py\n",

Words are selected in two ways: (1) whether they are fully contained in the given rectangle, or (2) whether their bbox has a non-empty intersection with it. Look at the above picture to compare these effects. The bottom vertical coordinates y1 of the words are rounded to cope with any artifacts that may be caused by e.g. font changes or similar things.\n",
