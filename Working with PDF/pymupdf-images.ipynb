To create a 300 dpi image of a page specify pix = page.get_pixmap(dpi=300). Apart from notation brevity, this approach has the additional advantage that the dpi value is saved with the image file – which does not happen automatically when using the Matrix notation."

The reverse is also true: except Page.rect, resp. Page.bound() (both reflect when the page is rotated), all coordinates returned by methods and attributes pertain to the unrotated page.\n",

    "So the returned value of e.g. Page.get_image_bbox() will not change if you do a Page.set_rotation(). The same is true for coordinates returned by Page.get_text(), annotation rectangles, and so on. If you want to find out, where an object is located in rotated coordinates, multiply the coordinates with Page.rotation_matrix. There also is its inverse, Page.derotation_matrix, which you can use when interfacing with other readers, which may behave differently in this respect.\n",

    "# How to Extract Images: PDF Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any other “object” in a PDF, images are identified by a cross reference number (xref, an integer). If you know this number, you have two ways to access the image’s data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a Pixmap of the image with instruction pix = pymupdf.Pixmap(doc, xref). This method is very fast (single digit micro-seconds). The pixmap’s properties (width, height, …) will reflect the ones of the image. In this case there is no way to tell which image format the embedded original has.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Extract the image with img = doc.extract_image(xref). This is a dictionary containing the binary image data as img[“image”]. A number of meta data are also provided – mostly the same as you would find in the pixmap of the image. The major difference is string img[“ext”], which specifies the image format: apart from “png”, strings like “jpeg”, “bmp”, “tiff”, etc. can also occur. Use this string as the file extension if you want to store to disk. The execution speed of this method should be compared to the combined speed of the statements pix = pymupdf.Pixmap(doc, xref);pix.tobytes(). If the embedded image is in PNG format, the speed of Document.extract_image() is about the same (and the binary image data are identical). Otherwise, this method is thousands of times faster, and the image data is much smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question remains: “How do I know those ‘xref’ numbers of images?”. There are two answers to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. “Inspect the page objects:” Loop through the items of Page.get_images(). It is a list of list, and its items look like [xref, smask, …], containing the xref of an image. This xref can then be used with one of the above methods. Use this method for valid (undamaged) documents. Be wary however, that the same image may be referenced multiple times (by different pages), so you might want to provide a mechanism avoiding multiple extracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. “No need to know:” Loop through the list of all xrefs of the document and perform a Document.extract_image() for each one. If the returned dictionary is empty, then continue – this xref is no image. Use this method if the PDF is damaged (unusable pages). Note that a PDF often contains “pseudo-images” (“stencil masks”) with the special purpose of defining the transparency of some other image. You may want to provide logic to exclude those from extraction. Also have a look at the next section."

    "# How to Handle Image Masks\n",
    "Some images in PDFs are accompanied by image masks. In their simplest form, masks represent alpha (transparency) bytes stored as separate images. In order to reconstruct the original of an image, which has a mask, it must be “enriched” with transparency bytes taken from its mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether an image does have such a mask can be recognized in one of two ways in PyMuPDF:\n",
    "\n",
    "An item of Document.get_page_images() has the general format (xref, smask, ...), where xref is the image’s xref and smask, if positive, then it is the xref of a mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "The (dictionary) results of Document.extract_image() have a key “smask”, which also contains any mask’s xref if positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "If smask == 0 then the image encountered via xref can be processed as it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "To recover the original image using PyMuPDF, the procedure depicted as follows must be executed:\n",
    "\n",
    "_images/img-stencil.jpg\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        pix1 = pymupdf.Pixmap(doc.extract_image(xref)[\"image\"])    # (1) pixmap of image w/o alpha\n",
    "        mask = pymupdf.Pixmap(doc.extract_image(smask)[\"image\"])   # (2) mask pixmap\n",
    "        pix = pymupdf.Pixmap(pix1, mask)                           # (3) copy of pix1, image mask added\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "Step (1) creates a pixmap of the basic image. Step (2) does the same with the image mask. Step (3) adds an alpha channel and fills it with transparency information.\n",

    "# How to Create Vector Images\n",
