    "###### This class is for PDF only.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class represents a PDF Form field, also called a “widget”. Throughout this documentation, we are using these terms synonymously. Fields technically are a special case of PDF annotations, which allow users with limited permissions to enter information in a PDF. This is primarily used for filling out forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like annotations, widgets live on PDF pages. Similar to annotations, the first widget on a page is accessible via Page.first_widget and subsequent widgets can be accessed via the Widget.next property.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Changed in version 1.16.0) MuPDF no longer treats widgets as a subset of general annotations. Consequently, Page.first_annot and Annot.next() will deliver non-widget annotations exclusively, and be None if only form fields exist on a page. Vice versa, Page.first_widget and Widget.next() will only show widgets. This design decision is purely internal to MuPDF; technically, links, annotations and fields have a lot in common and also continue to share the better part of their code within (Py-) MuPDF."

    "        Return the names of On / Off (i.e. selected / clicked or not) states a button field may have. While the ‘Off’ state usually is also named like so, the ‘On’ state is often given a name relating to the functional context, for example ‘Yes’, ‘Female’, etc.\n",
