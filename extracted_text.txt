Linking the CIOMS I form to the ICH E2B format 



 
The intention of this document is to link fields in CIOMS I reporting form with data elements in the international transfer format ICH E2B (R2 
and R3).  
 
For most of the fields in CIOMS I there are corresponding data elements in ICH E2B. However, ICH E2B is a flexible electronic format with 
several data elements (both as structured information and in free text) intended for data transfer between different databases. CIOMS I is a 
pure reporting form with limited amount of fields (less structured and mostly in free text).  
This implies some challenges in the mapping of data between CIOMS I and ICH E2B and therefore the table with suggestions in this document 
should only work as an overview and a guideline.  
For example, the free text field ‘DESCRIBE REACTION(S)’ in CIOMS I can be linked to several structured and free text data elements in ICH E2B. 
See page 4-5 in table below.
